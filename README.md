## Introduction

The following introduction was copied from [1]. Our motivation was to confirm the values in the
table, find optimal algorithms for values where only a lower bound exists and add some values
for `n=16`.

This page gives algorithms for finding the `i'th largest of 'n` elements with the fewest possible
comparisons.

The problem has been widely studied in literature. **Knuth**[2] gives a brief history of the problem and
some known upper and lower bounds. Optimal algorithms are known for any `n' when i` is one or two,
but for example for finding the median (i = n/2), there is a significant performance gap from the
best known algorithm `(approximately 2.97 n + o(n) comparisons)` to the tightest known minimum
`(2 n - o(n))`.

Many other special cases are also known, such as the ones given in the table below. Many of these
were previously found by **Gasarch, Kelly and Pugh**[3] who introduced computer searching to find the
optimal selection algorithms. The additional results presented in the table above have been
found by **my independent implementation**[4], but it probably shares many characteristics with Gasarch's.

Numbers marked with one asterisk are new lower bounds. Numbers marked with two asterisks improve
previously known algorithms. Since I found no previous studies of `V(14,3)` and `V(15,3)` in the
literature, I have marked it with a question mark.

Click the number to get the optimal selection algorithm. If an optimal algorithm is not known,
I've given the tightest known lower bound and the best known algorithm.

## Requirements

Since the project depends on the rust crate nauty, a C compiler able to compile it is required in addition to Rust. 

To install `Rust` please follow the guide on the **website**[5].

The package version used to create the data is

```shell
$ rustc -V
rustc 1.77.0-nightly (6ae4cfbbb 2024-01-17)
$ pacman -Q nauty
nauty 1:2.8.8-2
$ pacman -Q clang
clang 16.0.6-1
```

## Quick start

Having all required packages installed, starting a calculation on your own is straight forward.

```shell
cargo run --release -- -n 10 -i 3
```

This will start calculating compares starting at the **i=4th** (index starts at 0) value for a list of **n=10** and will continue calculating until you stop.

For more details please read

```shell
./target/release/selection_generator --help
```

## Calculation times

One can find the calculation times in the `times*.txt` files. The times were generated using the hardware listed in the []

## Hardware used

The hardware used to calculate these results was

```shell
<TBD>
```
