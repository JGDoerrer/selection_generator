%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[10pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}


\usepackage[all,pdf]{xy}
\usepackage{lmodern,amssymb}

\usepackage{float}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{caption}
\usepackage{subcaption}
\usepackage{tikz}

% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex






% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%
% paper title
% Titles are generally capitalized except for words such as a, an, and, as,

% not capitalized unless they are the first or last word of the title.

\title{Finding Lower Bounds for the Number of Comparison in Selection Algorithms}
%
%
% author names and IEEE memberships
% note positions of commas and nonbreaking spaces ( ~ ) LaTeX will not break
% a structure at a ~ so this keeps an author's name from being broken across
% two lines.
% use \thanks{} to gain access to the first footnote area
% a separate \thanks must be used for each paragraph as LaTeX2e's \thanks
% was not built to handle multiple paragraphs
%
%
%\IEEEcompsocitemizethanks is a special \thanks that produces the bulleted
% lists the Computer Society journals use for "first footnote" author
% affiliations. Use \IEEEcompsocthanksitem which works much like \item
% for each affiliation group. When not in compsoc mode,
% \IEEEcompsocitemizethanks becomes like \thanks and
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem becomes a line break with idention. This
% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc 
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript
% received ..."  text while in non-compsoc journals this is reversed. Sigh.

\author{Josua Dörrer, Konrad Gendle, Johanna Hofmann, Julius von Smercek, Andreas Steding% <-this % stops a space

  }}

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.



% The paper headers
\markboth{Bachelor-Forschungsprojekt}%

% The only time the second header will appear is for the odd numbered pages
% after the title page when using the twoside option.
% 
% *** Note that you probably will NOT want to include the author's ***

% You can use \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview for conditional compilation here if
% you desire.



% The publisher's ID mark at the bottom of the page is less important with
% Computer Society journal papers as those publications place the marks
% outside of the main text columns and, therefore, unlike regular IEEE
% journals, the available text space is not reduced by their presence.
% If you want to put a publisher's ID mark on the page you can do it like
% this:
%\IEEEpubid{0000--0000/00\$00.00~\copyright~2015 IEEE}
% or like this to get the Computer Society new two part style.
%\IEEEpubid{\makebox[\columnwidth]{\hfill 0000--0000/00/\$00.00~\copyright~2015 IEEE}%
%\hspace{\columnsep}\makebox[\columnwidth]{Published by the IEEE Computer Society\hfill}}
% Remember, if you use this you must call \IEEEpubidadjcol in the second
% column for its text to clear the IEEEpubid mark (Computer Society jorunal
% papers don't need this extra clearance.)



% use for special paper notices
%\IEEEspecialpapernotice{(Invited Paper)}



% for Computer Society papers, we must declare the abstract and index terms
% PRIOR to the title within the \IEEEtitleabstractindextext IEEEtran
% command as these need to go into the title area created by \maketitle.
% As a general rule, do not put math, special symbols or citations
% in the abstract or keywords.
\IEEEtitleabstractindextext{%

  % Note that keywords are not normally used for peerreview papers.

    Add some keywords of your summary/the article. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2001-02478,}
  \end{IEEEkeywords}}


% make the title area
\maketitle


% To allow for easy dual compilation without having to reenter the
% abstract/keywords data, the \IEEEtitleabstractindextext text will
% not be used in maketitle, but will appear (i.e., to be "transported")
% here as \IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext when the compsoc 
% or transmag modes are not selected <OR> if conference mode is selected 
% - because all conference papers position the abstract like regular
% papers do.
\IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext
% \IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext has no effect when using
% compsoc or transmag under a non-conference mode.



% For peer review papers, you can put extra information on the cover
% page as needed:
% \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview
% \begin{center} \bfseries EDICS Category: 3-BBND \end{center}
% \fi
%
% For peerreview papers, this IEEEtran command inserts a page break and
% creates the second title. It will be ignored for other modes.
\IEEEpeerreviewmaketitle



\IEEEraisesectionheading{\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}}
% Computer Society journal (but not conference!) papers do something unusual
% with the very first section heading (almost always called "Introduction").
% They place it ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls does not automatically do
% this for you, but you can achieve this effect with the provided
% \IEEEraisesectionheading{} command. Note the need to keep any \label that
% is to refer to the section immediately after \section in the above as
% \IEEEraisesectionheading puts \section within a raised box.




% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.


% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\end{figure}

% Note that the IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.
% However, the Computer Society has been known to put floats at the bottom.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% the IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} problem of selecting the $i$th largest element in a list of $n$ elements is a well known problem in computer science. The problem can be solved by sorting the list and then selecting the $i$th element. However, this approach has a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$. For some small values of i and n algorithms could be found that require fewer comparisons. For example, the fourth largest element in a list of 12 elements can be found with 12 comparisons in the worst case (improving the theoretical bound of $n \log n$ by factor 2). \cite[p. 212]{Knuth1973} Generally, by introducing elegant methods for comparing the elements of a list, upper bounds can be established. On the contrary, showing that a method uses the optimal amount of comparisons requires an extended set of tools. Gasarch et al. \cite{Gasarch1996} first introduced computer search to find optimal numbers of comparisons for small values of $n$ and $i$ as well as upper bounds for slightly larger values of $i$ and $n$.

On his website, Kenneth Oksanen \cite{Oksanen} published a computer search algorithm for this problem along with results that improve previously known lower bounds for n=13, n=14 and n=15. However, the results are not published in a scientific journal and lack explanation. \newline
%Der folgende Abschnitt sollte im Hinblick auf unsere Vorgehensweise beim Verfassen der Ausarbeitung angepasst werden. Indem wir uns evtl. im Vorfeld auf eine genaue Formulierung verständigen, platzieren wir den roten Faden für die restliche Ausarbeitung.
In this project we are interested in retracing the results of Oksanen by implementing his algorithm and exploring the benefit of Forward Search versus Backward Search. Furthermore, the potential of Bidirectional search, Alpha-Beta-Pruning and the exploitation of compatible Posets is assessed. \newline

Optimal algorithms are known for any `n' when `i' is one or two, but for example for finding
the median ($i = n/2$), there is a significant performance gap from the best known algorithm
(approximately $2.97 n + o(n)$ comparisons) to the tightest known minimum $(2 n - o\left (n \right )$).

Many other special cases are also known, such as the ones given in the table below. Many of
these were previously found by Gasarch, Kelly and Pugh who introduced computer searching to
find the optimal selection algorithms. The additional results presented in the table above have
been found by my independent implementation, but it probably shares many characteristics with
Gasarch's.



\section{Fundamentals}
\subsection{Algorithms for Finding the i-th largest of n elements}
The basic algorithm for finding the $i$th largest element of a list of $n$ elements is to compare elements pairwise until the $i$th largest element can be deduced. 
This process can be regarded as building up a partial order where each edge represents a comparison.
\subsubsection{Example}
For example, David G. Doren found an elegant method to determine the fourth largest element in a list of eight elements with twelve comparisons. \cite[p. 212]{Knuth1973}. Let $X_1, \dots , X_8$ be the elements of the list.
First compare $X_1 : X_2$ and $X_3 : X_4$. 
Then, compare the larger two elements.
The same is done for $X_5 : X_6$ and $X_7 : X_8$.
To abstract from the actual outcome the elements can be renamed so that $X_1 < X_2 < X_4 > X_3$ and  $X_5 < X_6 < X_8 > X_7$.
Then, compare $X_2 : X_6$ and assume $X_2 < X_6$.
The resulting hasse diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:Hasse_i4_n8_a} shows that there are at least four elements that are larger than $X_1$. Therefore, $X_1$ can be excluded from further considerations.
Similar applies to $X_8$ which is found to be larger than at least 5 elements.
The remaining problem is equivalent to finding the third largest element in a list of six elements.
Next, compare $X_2 : X_7$.
The smaller element can be excluded, since it will be smaller than three elements. 
Consider the worst case where $X_2 < X_7$. The resulting hasse diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:Hasse_i4_n8_b} shows that the third largest element can be found with at most four more comparisons.

    and so cannot be the median. The larger of the two elements in the final comparison is the
    median. \cite{Eppstein_Median}}

\subsection{Partial Order}
A partial order, often simply called a reflexive, weak, or non-strict partial order, is a
homogeneous relation $\leq$ on a set $P$ that satisfies reflexivity, anti symmetry, and
transitivity. For any $a, b, c \in P$, it must adhere to the following conditions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Reflexivity: $a \leq a$, meaning every element is related to itself.
  \item Antisymmetry: If $a \leq b$ and $b \leq a$, then $a = b$, implying no two distinct elements precede each other.
  \item Transitivity: If $a \leq b$ and $b \leq c$, then $a \leq c$.
\end{itemize}

A non-strict partial order is also known as an antisymmetric preorder. %[\todo{cite:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set}]

\subsection{Compatible Posets}

Let $P_{n,i}$ be a poset.
\begin{definition}
  A poset $R_{n,i}$ is compatible with $P_{n,i}$, if $R_{n,i}$ is solved and $P_{n,i} \subseteq R_{n,i}$.
  Let $$\mathcal{C}(P_{n,i}) = \{ R_{n,i} \text{ canonical poset } \mid R_{n,i} \text{ compatible with } P_{n,i} \}$$ be the set of all compatible posets of $P$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  A poset $P_{n,i}$ is solved iff $|\mathcal{C}(P_{n,i})| = 1$.

  $\implies$: trivial

  $\impliedby$: trivial
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
  Adding a comparison reduces the number of compatible posets by a factor $\leq 2$.

  Let $R_{n,i} = P_{n,i} + uv$.

  \begin{align*}
    \mathcal{C}(R_{n,i}) & = \mathcal{C}(P_{n,i}) \cap \{ \text{Posets with } uv \}   \\
    \mathcal{C}(P_{n,i}) & = \mathcal{C}(P_{n,i} + uv) \cup \mathcal{C}(P_{n,i} + vu) \\
  \end{align*}

  $$2 \cdot |\mathcal{C}(R_{n,i})| \leq |\mathcal{C}(P_{n,i})|$$
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}
  A poset $P_{n,i}$ is not solvable in less than $\log_2(|\mathcal{C}(P_{n,i})|)$ comparisons.


\end{theorem}
