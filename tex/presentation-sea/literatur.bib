  abstract   = {A classic problem in computer science is selection: given a list of n numbers, find the ith largest, using the fewest number of comparisons. We are interested in the exact number of comparisons required for specific small values of i and n. We have written a program that can be used either to find the exact number of comparisons for very low values of i and n, or to find upper bounds on the number of comparisons for slightly larger values of i and n. In some cases we have improved on the results in the literature and have additional improvements contingent on a conjecture.},

  abstract = {We report the current state of the graph isomorphism problem from the practical point of view. After describing the general principles of the refinement-individualization paradigm and pro ving its validity, we explain how it is implemented in several of the key implementations. In particular, we bring the description of the best known program nauty up to date and describe an innovative approach called Traces that outperforms the competitors for many difficult graph classes. Detailed comparisons against saucy, Bliss and conauto are presented.}
